I used react best practices in implementing a signup feature that took in users information and then output it like a result
During the task above, I implemented a range slider feature for some of the required information
I retrieved data from an API and displayed it in one of the tasks required of me
I also implemented form features whereby answering a yes in some questions will lead to more questions being popped out and answering a no in some will lead to the form not changing.
I also worked with other interns whenever I had difficulty, I asked lots of questions and it made my work faster
In one of the tasks given to create a signup/login and then implement a task tracker, I implemented the design and feature of a drag and drop using an external react library.
I worked with key react concepts like React-router, hooks, props, state management and some other key concepts.
I used different styling technologies like tailwind CSS, styled-components and vanilla CSS
